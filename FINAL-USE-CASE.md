### n8n Workflow Architecture

```
Monday 6:00 AM (Weekly Trigger)
    ↓
Parallel Data Collection:
├── Eventbrite API → Extract business events
├── Meetup API → Extract professional groups
├── RSS Feeds → Parse chamber announcements
├── Web Scrapers → DMCC, DIFC calendars
└── Social APIs → Facebook, LinkedIn events
    ↓
Data Processing Pipeline:
├── Merge all sources into unified format
├── Deduplicate (same event from multiple sources)
├── Filter: Professional keywords, UAE location, next 30 days
├── Categorize: Industry, professional type, networking score
└── Enrich: Venue details, parking, accessibility
    ↓
Quality Control:
├── Auto-approve: Trusted sources (Dubai Chambers, DMCC)
├── Manual review: Unknown organizers, low quality score
└── Reject: Spam, non-professional, past events
    ↓
Send to Airtable:
├── POST to /.netlify/functions/receive-events
├── Create records with is_approved = false
└── Slack/Email notification: "20 events ready for review"
    ↓
Manual Review (You):
├── Open Airtable moderation view
├── Check 20-50 events (10 minutes)
├── Approve quality events (check box)
└── Events appear on website immediately
```

**Automation Level:**
- Month 1-3: 50% auto-approved (trusted sources only)
- Month 4-6: 70% auto-approved (ML quality scoring)
- Month 7-12: 85% auto-approved (proven patterns)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** n8n workflows break (API changes)
**Mitigation:**

- Alert on <50 events/week collected
- Manual fallback: Add events via Airtable form

**Risk:** Affiliate links stop converting
**Mitigation:**
- Track conversion rates per source
- Diversify affiliate partnerships
- Add direct organizer relationships

**Mitigation:**
- Archive past events monthly
- Upgrade to Plus plan ($20/month) at 1,200 records

---

### Business Risks

**Risk:** Low traffic (SEO doesn't work)
**Mitigation:**
- LinkedIn content marketing (share weekly event picks)
- Partner with chambers (cross-promotion)
- Paid ads (Google: "dubai fintech events")

**Risk:** No one logs in (<5%)
**Mitigation:**
- Pivot: Skip email, focus on SEO + affiliate revenue
- Add value: "Login to save events" feature
- Retarget: Cookies + Facebook pixel for remarketing

**Risk:** Affiliate commissions too low
**Mitigation:**
- Add sponsored event placements (Month 4)
