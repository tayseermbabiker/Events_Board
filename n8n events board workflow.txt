i want to buiild a workflow where everyday an ai agent would scan all the social media platforms and a list of websites, look for professional events happening then take the related info and fill it in airrtable. the airtable

Assistant
That’s a great use case for n8n! Here’s how you can approach building this workflow, step by step:

1. Gathering Event Data from Social Media & Websites
Social Media Platforms:
Use n8n’s built-in nodes for platforms like Twitter (X), LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. For platforms without direct nodes, you can use the HTTP Request node to access their APIs (if available) or RSS feeds.
Websites:
For websites, use the HTTP Request node to fetch pages, and the HTML Extract node to parse event information. If the sites have RSS feeds, use the RSS Feed Read node.
2. Using AI to Extract Event Information
Use the OpenAI or Google AI nodes to process the raw text and extract structured event details (title, date, location, description, etc.).
You can send the scraped content to the AI node and ask it to return only event-related information in a structured format.
3. Storing Data in Airtable
Use the Airtable node to create or update records in your Airtable base with the extracted event information.
4. Scheduling the Workflow
Use the Cron node to trigger the workflow daily.
Example Workflow Structure
Cron (trigger daily)
HTTP Request / Social Media Nodes (fetch data)
HTML Extract / AI Node (parse and extract event info)
Airtable (store the data)
Tips & Considerations
API Access: Some social media APIs require approval or paid plans for event data.
Rate Limits: Be mindful of API rate limits and website scraping policies.
AI Prompting: Carefully craft your AI prompts to extract only relevant event details.
Deduplication: Add logic to avoid duplicate events in Airtable.
If you need help with a specific part (e.g., parsing event info with AI, setting up Airtable, or connecting to a particular social platform), let me know! I can provide more detailed guidance or example expressions for that step.
