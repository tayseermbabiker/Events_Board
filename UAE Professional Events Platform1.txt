UAE Professional Events Platform
Technical Architecture & System Design
Executive Summary
This document outlines the technical architecture for a UAE professional events aggregation platform. The system prioritizes low operational overhead, automated data collection, and scalable infrastructure that can later expand to US markets. The architecture is designed for a solo operator with minimal ongoing maintenance requirements.
System Overview
Architecture Philosophy
The platform follows a serverless-first approach with three core principles:
•	Zero infrastructure management: No servers to maintain, patch, or monitor
•	Cost scales with usage: Near-zero costs at low traffic, predictable scaling
•	Automation-first: Minimal manual intervention for daily operations
Technology Stack
Layer	Technology	Rationale
Frontend	Next.js + Vercel	SSR for SEO, free tier sufficient for MVP
Database	Airtable → Supabase	Start simple, migrate when >10k records
Automation	n8n (self-hosted)	Visual workflows, scraper orchestration
Email	Resend or Loops	Developer-friendly, generous free tier
Search	Algolia or Meilisearch	Fast faceted search for events
Analytics	Plausible or Umami	Privacy-friendly, lightweight
Data Architecture
Event Schema
Core event object structure:
Event {
  id: string (UUID)
  title: string
  description: text
  date_start: datetime
  date_end: datetime
  location: { venue, city, emirate, coordinates }
  category: enum [Healthcare, Finance, Tech, Legal, HR, Marketing]
  subcategory: string
  event_type: enum [Conference, Workshop, Networking, Seminar, Summit]
  price: { amount, currency, is_free }
  organizer: { name, website, contact }
  source: { url, scraped_at, source_name }
  affiliate_link: string (nullable)
  is_featured: boolean
  status: enum [draft, published, cancelled]
}
Data Collection System
Source Priority Matrix
Source	Method	Frequency	Priority
Eventbrite UAE	API	Daily	P1
Meetup	API	Daily	P1
LinkedIn Events	Scrape (careful)	2x/week	P2
Chamber of Commerce	Scrape	Weekly	P1
DIFC Events	Scrape	Weekly	P1
Industry Associations	Manual + Scrape	Weekly	P2
Direct Submissions	Form/API	Real-time	P0
n8n Workflow Architecture
The scraping system runs as scheduled n8n workflows:
1.	Trigger: Cron schedule (daily 6 AM GST for most sources)
2.	Fetch: HTTP Request node pulls source pages/APIs
3.	Parse: HTML Extract or JSON nodes extract event data
4.	Transform: Function node normalizes to Event schema
5.	Dedupe: Check against existing events by source URL
6.	Categorize: AI node (Claude) classifies professional vs non-professional
7.	Store: Airtable/Supabase node saves new events
8.	Alert: Slack/Email notification on errors or anomalies
Frontend Architecture
Page Structure
/                          # Homepage with featured events
/events                    # All events with filters
/events/[category]         # Category pages (healthcare, finance, tech)
/events/[category]/[slug]  # Individual event page
/calendar                  # Calendar view
/submit                    # Event submission form
/newsletter                # Newsletter signup
/blog/[slug]               # SEO content pages
SEO Strategy
Each page is optimized for specific search intents:
•	Category pages: "Dubai healthcare conferences 2025", "UAE fintech events"
•	Event pages: Structured data (Event schema) for Google rich results
•	Blog posts: "Best tech conferences in Dubai 2025", "UAE medical events calendar"
•	Static generation: All pages pre-rendered at build time for fast loading
Email & Newsletter System
Newsletter Flows
Automated email sequences:
1.	Welcome sequence: Onboarding + preference selection (categories, frequency)
2.	Weekly digest: Personalized event roundup based on preferences
3.	Event reminders: 24h before events user has expressed interest in
4.	Re-engagement: Win-back inactive subscribers after 30 days
Subscriber Segmentation
•	By industry: Healthcare, Finance, Tech, Legal, HR, Marketing
•	By location: Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Northern Emirates
•	By engagement: Active, Passive, At-risk, Churned
•	By source: Organic, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Referral
Monetization Infrastructure
Revenue Streams (Phased)
Phase	Revenue Type	Technical Needs	Trigger
1 (Month 6+)	Featured listings	Stripe, is_featured flag	1,000+ monthly visitors
2 (Month 9+)	Newsletter sponsors	Sponsor slots in templates	2,000+ email subscribers
3 (Month 12+)	Affiliate commissions	Tracking pixels, UTMs	Partnership agreements
4 (Month 15+)	Organizer dashboard	Analytics API, Auth	20+ direct organizers
Infrastructure Costs
Monthly Burn Rate (Year 1)
Service	Free Tier	At Scale
Vercel (hosting)	$0	$20/mo
Airtable/Supabase	$0	$25/mo
n8n (self-hosted on Railway)	$5	$10/mo
Email (Resend/Loops)	$0	$20/mo
Domain + DNS	$15/yr	$15/yr
Total Monthly	~$6	~$75
Scalability & US Expansion
Multi-Region Architecture
The system is designed to support geographic expansion:
•	Database: Region field enables filtering; same schema works globally
•	Scrapers: Modular n8n workflows; add new sources without changing core
•	Frontend: Subdomain strategy (uae.proevents.com, nyc.proevents.com)
•	Email: Timezone-aware sending, region-specific templates
US Launch Technical Requirements
1.	Add US-specific scrapers (Eventbrite US, local chambers)
2.	Create city-specific landing pages for SEO
3.	Adjust timezone handling in email system
4.	Add USD pricing for monetization features
5.	Deploy Vercel edge functions for US latency optimization
Security Considerations
•	Authentication: Optional; magic links via email (no passwords to manage)
•	API keys: Stored in environment variables, never in code
•	Rate limiting: Vercel edge middleware for API routes
•	Data privacy: GDPR-compliant email preferences, easy unsubscribe
•	Backups: Daily Airtable/Supabase exports to cloud storage
Appendix: Key Decisions Log
Decision	Choice	Rationale
Database	Airtable → Supabase	Start fast, migrate when needed
Framework	Next.js	SSR for SEO, Vercel integration
Automation	n8n self-hosted	Visual, flexible, low cost
Auth strategy	Optional, magic links	Reduce friction, email is asset
Monetization timing	Month 6+	Build audience first
